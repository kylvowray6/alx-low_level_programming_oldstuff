- Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

- Prototype: char *_strdup(char *str);
- The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.
- Returns NULL if str = NULL
- On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available

#### [2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life](2-str_concat.c)
